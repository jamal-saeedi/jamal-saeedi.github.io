** Welcome to my journey through the exciting world of engineering and artificial intelligence.

I began my academic path by earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Biomedical Engineering from Sahand University of Tabriz, Iran, in 2006. This sparked my passion for exploring the intersection of technology and science.

Building on this foundation, I pursued higher education and attained both Master's and Ph.D. degrees in Electronic Engineering from Amirkabir University of Tehran, Iran, in 2010 and 2015, respectively. These milestones catalyzed my deep dive into the realms of innovation and cutting-edge research.

My career took off in 2010 when I entered the dynamic world of industry, starting as a signal processing engineer. Over the years, my expertise expanded to encompass computer vision and machine learning, making me a versatile professional in the field. I've had the privilege of working on a wide range of projects, each providing valuable insights and honing my skills.

In 2019, I embarked on an exciting new chapter as a postdoctoral researcher at the prestigious Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IDSIA, USI-SUPSI). Here, I've had the opportunity to contribute to groundbreaking research and collaborate with brilliant minds in the AI community.

Throughout my journey, I've acquired a wealth of knowledge spanning system design, signal and image processing, computer vision, information fusion, machine learning, and deep learning. I specialize in working with digital data from various sensors, including microphones, cameras, radar antennas, EEG electrodes, load cells, and more. My mission is to harness the power of data to drive innovation and solve complex problems.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
