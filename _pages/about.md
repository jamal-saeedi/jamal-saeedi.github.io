I began my education by earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Biomedical Engineering from Sahand University of Tabriz, Iran, in 2006. This experience sparked my interest in the intersection of technology and science.

I then pursued a Master's degree and a Ph.D. in Electronic Engineering from Amirkabir University of Tehran, Iran, which I completed in 2010 and 2015, respectively. These programs deepened my understanding of innovation and cutting-edge research.

In 2010, I began my career as a signal processing engineer. Over time, I expanded my skillset and made me a more adaptable professional by learning about computer vision and machine learning. I worked on a variety of projects, each of which taught me something new and helped me improve my skills.

In 2019, I started a new chapter in my career as a postdoctoral researcher at the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IDSIA, USI-SUPSI). This opportunity allowed me to conduct groundbreaking research and collaborate with brilliant minds in the AI community.

Over the years, I have developed a deep understanding of system design, signal and image processing, computer vision, information fusion, machine learning, and deep learning. I am proficient in working with digital data from a variety of sensors, including microphones, cameras, radar antennas, EEG electrodes, load cells and more. My goal is to use the power of data to drive innovation and solve difficult problems.

## Research Interests

| Applied Machine Learning | Anomaly Detection | Normalizing Flows | 3D Computer Vision |
| Self-Supervised Learning| Deep Generative Modeling | Object Detection and Tracking | Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting |

As an applied engineer, I have a passion for using the latest AI technologies, such as deep learning, computer vision, and machine learning, to solve real-world problems. I’m interested in a variety of applied tasks, including supervised and unsupervised classification, image-based regression, image segmentation, object detection and tracking, 3D computer vision, remote sensing, and non-stationary time-series forecasting.

As a dedicated researcher, I’m excited to help advance the field of AI research. I’m particularly interested in developing new deep learning generative models, through variational autoencoders and normalizing flow techniques. I’m using these models to develop new solutions for anomaly detection, semantic image segmentation, signal and image enhancement, and image augmentation, among other applications.

I believe that AI has the potential to make a positive impact on the world, and I am committed to using my skills and knowledge to make that happen.
