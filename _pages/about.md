## Welcome to my journey through the exciting world of engineering and artificial intelligence.

I began my academic path by earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Biomedical Engineering from Sahand University of Tabriz, Iran, in 2006. This sparked my passion for exploring the intersection of technology and science.

Building on this foundation, I pursued higher education and attained both Master's and Ph.D. degrees in Electronic Engineering from Amirkabir University of Tehran, Iran, in 2010 and 2015, respectively. These milestones catalyzed my deep dive into the realms of innovation and cutting-edge research.

My career took off in 2010 when I entered the dynamic world of industry, starting as a signal processing engineer. Over the years, my expertise expanded to encompass computer vision and machine learning, making me a versatile professional in the field. I've had the privilege of working on a wide range of projects, each providing valuable insights and honing my skills.

In 2019, I embarked on an exciting new chapter as a postdoctoral researcher at the prestigious Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IDSIA, USI-SUPSI). Here, I've had the opportunity to contribute to groundbreaking research and collaborate with brilliant minds in the AI community.

Throughout my journey, I've acquired a wealth of knowledge spanning system design, signal and image processing, computer vision, information fusion, machine learning, and deep learning. I specialize in working with digital data from various sensors, including microphones, cameras, radar antennas, EEG electrodes, load cells, and more. My mission is to harness the power of data to drive innovation and solve complex problems.


## Research Interests

As an applied engineer, I'm passionate about harnessing the latest AI technologies rooted in deep learning, computer vision, and machine learning for diverse applications. My expertise extends across a spectrum of tasks, including supervised and unsupervised classification, image-based regression, semantic segmentation, object detection and tracking, 3D computer vision, and non-stationary time-series forecasting.

Moreover, as a dedicated researcher, I'm deeply engaged in advancing the field of AI. My research endeavors focus on mastering deep learning generative models, particularly through variational autoencoders and normalizing flow techniques. These efforts enable me to contribute to cutting-edge solutions in anomaly detection, semantic segmentation, and time-series forecasting, pushing the boundaries of state-of-the-art methodologies.
