I started my education by getting a Bachelor of Science degree in Biomedical Engineering from Sahand University of Tabriz, Iran, in 2006. This made me interested in the overlap of technology and science.

I then got a Master's degree and a Ph.D. in Electronic Engineering from Amirkabir University of Tehran, Iran, in 2010 and 2015, respectively. This helped me learn more about innovation and cutting-edge research.

I started my career in 2010 as a signal processing engineer. Over time, I learned about computer vision and machine learning, which made me a more versatile professional. I worked on a variety of projects, each of which taught me something new and helped me improve my skills.

In 2019, I started a new chapter in my career as a postdoctoral researcher at the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IDSIA, USI-SUPSI). This gave me the chance to do groundbreaking research and work with brilliant people in the AI community.

Over the years, I have learned a lot about system design, signal and image processing, computer vision, information fusion, machine learning, and deep learning. I am good at working with digital data from different kinds of sensors, such as microphones, cameras, radar antennas, EEG electrodes, load cells and more. My goal is to use the power of data to drive innovation and solve difficult problems.

| Topic | Description |
|---|---|
| Applied Machine Learning | The use of machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. |
| Signal and Image Processing | The processing of signals and images to extract useful information. |
| Anomaly Detection | The identification of anomalous data points that deviate from the expected distribution. |
| Normalizing Flows | A type of machine learning model that can learn to transform data from one distribution to another. |
| Self-Supervised Learning | A type of machine learning where models are trained without labeled data. |
| Deep Generative Modeling | A type of machine learning that can generate new data samples from a learned distribution. |
| Object Detection and Tracking | The identification and localization of objects in images and videos. |
| Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting | The forecasting of time series data that is not constant over time. |

As an applied engineer, I love using the latest AI technologies, such as deep learning, computer vision, and machine learning, to solve real-world problems. I'm good at a variety of tasks, including: supervised and unsupervised classification, image-based regression, semantic segmentation, object detection and tracking, 3D computer vision, and non-stationary time-series forecasting.

Moreover, as a dedicated researcher, I'm excited to help advance the field of AI. I'm particularly interested in developing new deep learning generative models, through variational autoencoders and normalizing flow techniques. I'm using these models to develop new solutions for anomaly detection, semantic image segmentation, and image augmentation.
